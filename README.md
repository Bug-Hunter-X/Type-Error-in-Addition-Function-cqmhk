# Type Error in JavaScript Addition Function

This repository demonstrates a common type error in JavaScript and provides a solution. The original code attempts to add two variables without explicitly checking their data types.  If either variable is not a number, a type error occurs. The corrected code includes a type check to prevent this error.
